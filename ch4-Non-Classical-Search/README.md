## Non-Classical Search 

These algorithms are designed for task environments other than finding the shortest path to a goal in a fully-observable, deterministic and discrete environment (that classical search assumes). It is also called **local search**. 

- Hill climbing
- Simulated annealing 
- Genetic algorithm -> mutation and crossover
- Linear programming
- Convex optimisation

#### Non-deterministic environments

- AND-OR search 

#### Partially observable

- Belief state
    - Standard search
    - Incremental algos
- Exploration and build heuristics: Online search
