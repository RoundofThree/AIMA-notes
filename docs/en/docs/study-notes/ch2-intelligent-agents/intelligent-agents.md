## Intelligent Agents 

Key points:

- Agent and agent function (percept -> action mapping)
- Performance measure evaluates the behavior of the agent in the environment. Maximised by rational agent. 
- Task environment. It can be:
    - Fully or partially observable 
    - Deterministic or stochastic 
    - Single or multi agent
    - Episodic or sequential 
    - Static or dynamic 
    - Discrete or continuous
    - Known or unknown 
- Agent types:
    - Simple reflex based
    - Model-based 
    - Goal-based, eg. planner
    - Utility-based, eg. minimax
- Learning agents -> improve performance measure via 4 components:
    - Performance element
    - Critic (give feedback)
    - Learning element (add new rules to world)
    - Problem generator (explore domain)
- State representations:
    - Atomic -> search, game-playing, hidden Markov models, MDP
    - Factored -> CSP, planning, propositional logic, Bayesian networks, ML
    - Structured -> relational databases, first-order logic, first-order probability models, knowledge-based learning, NL
