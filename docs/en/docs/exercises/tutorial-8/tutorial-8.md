# Tutorial 8 â”€ Reinforcement learning 

## Monte Carlo Policy Evaluation

Consider three sample episodes. 

Using First-Visit and Every-Visit, what are $V(s)$ for A and B? 

$\gamma = 1$

## UCT Calculation

Calculate the UCT values for S1 through S3 based on the values presented below. Which state do we select?

$\alpha = 2$

| State | Total simulations | Win rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $S_0$ | 50 | - |
| $S_1$ | 15 | 10 |
| $S_2$ | 15 | 5 |
| $S_3$ | 20 | 10 |
