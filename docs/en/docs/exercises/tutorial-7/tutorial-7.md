## Classification

Consider the training data shown here from a binary classification problem. 

Table

### Question 1
Calculate the GINI index for all attributes. 

### Question 2
Which attribute would be first split (ie. the root node) of the decision tree?

## Regression
### Question 1 

Which of the following statements is true?

The line described by a regression function attempts to:

- Pass through as many points as possible.
- Pass through as few points as possible. 
- Minimise the number of points it touches. 
- **Minimise the squared distance from the points.**

### Question 2 
A regression equation has slope $33.57$. The mean $y$ is $132.71$ and the mean $x$ is $2.71$. What is the value of the intercept?

**Answer**: $y_0 = 132.71 - 33.57 * 2.71 = 123.0353$.

### Question 3
The regression equation $y = 5.57 - 0.065x$. How many tickets would you predict for a twenty-year-old?

**Answer**: $4.27$ tickets, roughly $4$.
